## About the ANSEL character set

[ANSI/NISO
Z39.47](https://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/document.php?document_id=6450),
also known as ANSEL, is a character set encoding used primarily for
bibliographic and genealogical data. It is used in library systems worldwide and is one of the official character
encodings supported by the [Gedcom
